These are the html and rmd files submitted for weekly assignments within the past 15 weeks. This repository is created to track my submissions and growth in analytics and machine learning skills. Eventually, I hope to be able to re-visit these projects in the near future to further polish up my skills and compile them in a better visual format i.e website, shiny app etc.
